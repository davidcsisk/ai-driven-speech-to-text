information or to volunteer please visit libor vox dot org recording by tony oliva a popular history of the art of music from the earliest times until the present my w s b matthews preface and introduction preface i have here endeavored to provide a readable account of the entire history of the art of music within the campus of a single small volume and treat the luxuriant and many cited later development with the particularities proportionate to it's importance and the greater interest app retaining to it from it's proximity to the times of the reader the range of the work can be most easily estimated from the table of contents pages five through ten it will be seen that i have attempted to cover the same extent of history in treating of which this standard music histories of know man ambrose fetish send others have employed from three times to ten times as much space in the nature of the case there will be differences of opinion among competent judges concerning my success in this difficult undertaking upon this point i can only plead absolute sincerity of purpose and a certain familiarity with the ground to be covered due to having treated it in my lectures in the chicago music college for five years to the extent to have about thirty five lectures yearly i have made free use of all the standard histories those effect is ambrose snowman brando give that hawkins bernie the writings of doctor hugo riemann doctor ritter professor fillmore and the dictionaries of grove and mendel as well as many monographs in all the leading modern languages i have divided the entire history into books play seen at the beginning of each book a general chapter defining this central idea and salient features of the step in development very recounted this student who will attentively peruse these check chapters in succession will have in them a fairly complete account of the entire progress w as be matthews chicago may fifth eighteen ninety one introduction first part number one that name music contains two ideas both of them important in our modern use of the term the general meaning is that of a pleasing modulation of sounds in this sense that term is used constantly by poets novel is sandy even in conversation as when we speak of the music of the forests the music of the book or the music of nature there is also a reminiscence of the etymological derivation of the term as something derived from the muses the fabled retinue of the greek god apollo who presided over all the higher operations of the mind and imagination thus the name music when applied to an art contains a suggestion of an inspiration as something derived from a special inner light or from a higher source outside the composer as all true imagination seems to be to those who exercise it number to music has to do with tones sounds selected on account of their musical quality and relations these tones again before becoming music and the artistic sense must be so join together is set in order controlled by the a human imagination that they express sentiment every manifestation of musical i'd has in it these two elements that fits selection of tones and second the use of them for expressing sentiment and feeling hands no practical art have music like every other or fine art has in it to elements and outer or technical were trained intelligence rules and teaching and study either principal means of progress and and enter the imagination and musical feeling which can indeed be strengthened by judicious experiencing hearing but which when wanting cannot be supplied by the teacher or the laws of their action reduced to satisfactory statement number three there is no fine art which reflects the activity of spirit more perfect leave and that of music there is something in the nature of this form of art which renders it particularly acceptable to quick and sensitive minds if evidence of this statement were needed beyond the intuitive as sent which every musical reader will immediately give it could easily be furnished in the correspondence between the activity of mind in general and in the eye of music in particular every great period of mental strength having been accompanied by a corresponding term of activity and music furthermore the development of the art of music has kept pace with the deepening of mental activity in general so that in these later times when the general movement of mind is so much greater than in ancient times and the operations of intellect so much more diffused throughout all classes the art of music has come to a period of unprecedented richness and strains part to number for the earlier forms of music were very simple ol the range of tones employed was a narrow and the habits of mind in the people employing them apparently calm and almost in active as time passed on more and more tones were added to the music and scales and more and more complicated relations recognize nice between them and the music thereby became more diversified in it's totally effects and they're in better adapted for the expression of a more energetic are more sensitive action of mind and feeling this has been the general course of the progress from the earliest times in which there was an art of music until now the to full progress of an education in tone perception and an increasing ability to employ elaborate combinations for the expression have feelings too high strung for the older forms of expression is observable in almost all stages of musical history and in our own days has received a striking illustration and the progress made in appreciating the works of the latest of the great musical geniuses ricard wagner whose music twenty five years ago was regarded by the public generally as unmusical and atrocious whereas now it is heard with pleasure and takes hold of the more advanced musical minds with a furnace beyond that of any other musical production the explanation is to be found in the development of find your tone perceptions the ability to coordinate tonal combination so distantly related that to the musical ears of a generation ago their relation was not recognized therefore to those ears they were not music wagner felt these strange combinations as music the deeper relations between tones and chords apparently remote he felt and employed them for the expression of his him imagination either years now feel them as he did an education has taken place number five it is all together likely that the education will still go on until many new combinations switch to our ears would be meaningless will become a part of the ordinary vernacular of the art d read or write or quite recently julius closer in their sept and eight points out a vast amount of musical material already contained within our tonal systems which as yet is entirely unused the new cards and relations thus suggested are quite in line with the additions made by wagner to the vocabulary of his day part three number six there are certain conditions which must be met before a fine art will be developed these it is worthwhile to consider briefly the state of art in any community or nation at any period of it's history depends upon a fortunate correspondence between two elements which we might call the internal and the external by the former is meant the inner movement of mind or spirit which must be of such depp fan force as to leave as surplus age after the material needs of existence have been net and every community where there is a certain degree of wealth leisure and a vigorous movement of mind this surplus force remaining over after the necessary wheels of common life had been set in motion will expand itself in some form of art or literature the nature of the form select good as the expression of this surplus force will depend upon the fashion the prevalent activity of the life of the day or in other words the environment illustrating this principle reference might be made to the condition of greek art in the flowering time of it's history when the wealth of athens was so great rate as to leave resources unemployed in the material uses of alive and when the intellectual movement was so splendid as to leave it until now a brilliant tradition of history only one form of art was preeminently successful here it was sculpture which at that time it's fullest development to such a degree that modern sculpture is only a week repetition of ancient works in this line so also the brilliant period of italian painting when the mental movement represented by leonardo da vinci michelangelo lorenzo they met it she and the pleasure loving existence the brilliant fat sandwich noble men and beautiful apparel women performed all sorts of allegorical representations and the colors groupings etc afforded the painter an endless variety of material and suggestion when rubens flourished in the netherlands a century he later similar conditions accompanied his appearance and the prolific manifestations of his genius in the same way music depends upon peculiar conditions of it's own they are three the vigor of the mental movement in general it's strength up upon the imaginative and so sentimental side and the suggestion from the environment and the way of musical instruments of adequate tonal powers such instruments never existed in the history of the arts until about the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the oregon the violin and the predecessor sir of the piano forte the spin it came to practical form at nearly the same time at the same time the instruments of plucked strings the guitars loots and other instruments which until then had occupied the exclusive attention of musicians began to go out moreover musical science had been worked out and the arts of counterpoint canonic imitation fugue harmony et cetera had all reached a high degree of perfection when back and handle appeared number seven the entire history of music is merely an illustration of these principles wherever there has been vigorous movement of mind and material prosperity and they have always been associated there has been an art of music the richness of which however has always been limited by the state of the musical ears of the people or generation and the perfection of their musical instruments the instruments are an indispensable ingredient in musical progress since it is only by means of instruments that tonal combinations can be exactly repeated the voice mastering the more difficult relations of tones only when the the ear has become quick to perceive tonal relations and tenacious to retain them in other words educated hence in the pages following the instruments peculiar to each epoch will receive the attention their importance deserves which is considerably more or then that usually allotted them in concise accounts of the history of this art number eight the conditions of a satisfactory art form or three unity the expression of a single room and idea variety the relief of the monotony due to the over ascendancy of unity or contrast an exact and definite form of variety and symmetry or the do proportion of the different parts of the work as a whole these principles universally recognized as governing in the other fine arts are equally valid in music as will be seen later all music oprah progress has been toward their more complete attainment and they do coordination into a single satisfactory whole every musical form that has ever been created is an effort to solve this problem and analysis shows which one of the leading principles has been most considered and the manner in which it has been carried out ancient music was very weak in all respects and never fully attained the first of these qualities modern music has mastered all three to a very respectable degree number nine the art of music appears to have been earliest of all the fine arts in the order of time but it has been longer than any of the others in reaching it's maturity most of the master works now current having been created within the last two centuries and the greater proportion of them within the last century sculpture came to it perfection in greece about five hundred b c architecture about twelve hundred two thirteen hundred a d when the great european cathedrals were built painting about fifteen hundred to sixteen hundred a d poetry like music representing the continual life of so all has never been completed new works of highest quality remaining possible as long as heights can feel and minds can conceive but the productions of shakespeare about sixteen fifty i believe to represent a point of perfection not likely to be surpassed music on the other half and has been continually progressive at least until the appearance of beethoven about the beginning of the present century and the romantic composers between eighteen thirty and the present time part for number ten the history of music may be divided into two oh great periods ancient and modern the christian era for mean a dividing line between them each of these periods again may be subdivided into to other periods one long the other quite short an apprentice period when types of instruments were being found out melodic or harm money forums mastered in other words the total sense undergoing it's primary education the other a master period when an art of music suddenly blossoms out complete and satisfactory according to the principal's recognized by the musicians of the time in the natural course of things such an arts having once found it's heart ought to go on to perfection but this has not generally been the case after a period a vigorous growth and the production of master worked suitable to the time a decline has ensued and at length musical prodigy activity has entirely ceased occasionally a cessation in our progress of this kind may have been dependent upon the failure of one or other of the primary conditions of successful art mentioned above especially the failure of material prosperity this had something to do with the cessation of progress in ancient egypt very likely but more often the stoppage of progress has been due to the exhaustion of the suggestive powers of the musical instruments in use the composer's of the music of ancient greece had for instruments only liars of six or eight strings with little vibrate eve power after ten centuries of use every suggestion in the compass of these instruments to furnish had been carried out if other and richer instruments could have been introduced no doubt greek music would have taken a new lease of life that is supposing that the material prosperity had remained constant the apprentice period serve ancient history extend back to the earliest traces of music which we have beginning perhaps with the early errands in central asia who max mean the represents as circling around the family alter at sunrise and sunset with clasped hands repeating a musical tones i him perhaps one of the earliest of those in the vados or as still older one from this early association of music with religious worship we derive some clean of our heredity of reverence for the arts as sentiment which in all ages has associated music with religious ritual and worship and down of which has come much of the tender regard we have for it as the expression of home and love in the higher aspects all the leading types of instruments were discovered in the early periods of human history but the full powers of the best have been reached only in recent times number eleven the art of music was highly esteemed in antiquity and every great nation had a form of it's own but it was only in three or four countries that a night was developed of such beauty and depth of principle as to have interest for us the countries where this was done were egypt greece and india number twelve modern music differs from ancient in too radical points tone allah lottie or that dependence of all tones in the series up on a single leading tone called the key and harmony or the satisfactory use of combined sounds this part of music was not possible to the ancients for want of correctly tune scales and the selection of the proper tone as key the only form of combine sounds which they used was the octave and rarely their fifth or fourth the idea of using other combine sounds then the octave seems to have been suggested by aristotle about three hundred b c period from the christian era until about fourteen hundred a d was devoted to apprentice work in this department of art the central concept wanted been a principle of unity after the beginning of the schools of the netherlands about fourteen hundred progress was very rapid the blossoming time of the modern art of music however cannot be considered to a big gun before about sixteen hundred when opera was commenced or seventeen hundred when instrumental music began to receive it's full development upon the whole the former of these dates is regarded as the more just and it will be so used in the press and to work and of preface and introduction
