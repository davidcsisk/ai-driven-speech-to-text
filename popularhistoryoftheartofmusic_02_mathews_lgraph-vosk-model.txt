chapter two of a popular history of the art of music from the earliest times until the present by w s be matthews this librivox recording is in the public domain music among the hebrews and assyrians second in point of antiquity but first and modern association comes the music of the hebrews and of the other allied nations of a syria and babylon from whom they learned a part of their art of music the place of music and the cult of the hebrews was very large and important yet in spite of this fact they never elevated their music into and art strictly so called there are no evidences of a progressive development of instruments and a tonal sense among this people as they were when first we meet them so they continued until they pass out of the view of history as a nation when the sacrificial fires went out in great temple at jerusalem on the eleventh of july a d seventy and the heathen roman defiled the altars of god in the beginning genesis tells us of one jubal who was the father of such as handle the hype and the oregon kinnaur and oh god the little triangular hype of a syria and the shepherds pipe which here stands for all sorts of wind instruments in the course of the centuries the heart changed its form somewhat and perhaps had an increased number of strings the flute was multiplied into several sub varieties and the horn was added from egypt they had the timbral a tambourine to which miriam the sister of moses intoned the sublime canticle the horse and his rider half he thrown into the sea there were also the sister those metallic instruments serving in the temple service the same purpose that the bells serve in the mass at the present day that namely of letting the distant worshippers know when the solemn moment has arrived vast numbers of musicians were employed in the greater temples service for thousand been mentioned in first chronicles twenty three three five as praising god with the kinds of instruments appointed by david according to josephus this greater number was vastly increased in still later times the numbers given been two hundred thousand trumpeters and forty thousand harper's and players upon stringed instruments it's even if we take the figures as greatly exaggerated they show nevertheless that they art of music had a great place among this people the instruments known were a few in number and their type underwent little change from the earliest days the principal instrument of the older time was the kinnaur or lie little triangular harp which we find in the record of the primeval jubal and which more than one thousand years later was played before saul to defend him from the evil spirit this also was the instrument most prominent in the temple service and this again was hung up on the willows of babylon the name kennaugh is said to have been phoenician a fact which points to this as the source of its derivation it is not easy to see how this could well be unless we regard the name as having been applied to the invention of juba at a later time for jubal lived many years and to terrier to the founding of the great metropolis of the mediterranean the camera was a small hype having from ten to twenty strings the usual forms i shown in the accompanying illustration the strings were fastened upon a metal rod lying across the face of the sounding board the type of construction is totally unlike that of the egyptian hypes and it's musical powers were apparently considerably inferior it's form was the following figure eight another instrument often mentioned in the english version of the bible is the sultry of which the forum is somewhat uncertain but is thought to have been four sided various ancient representations have been supposed to be this instrument but none of them satisfactorily at least not authoritatively it was probably a variety of harp the nebo is also said to been a salary but it's etymology points to the phoenician naval try and get a harp like a greek delta the forms of the solitary were four sided a or triangular it was probably the predecessor of the arab canon which again is much the same as the sun tier see figure twenty five there were two kinds of flute both of them read pipes the smaller being merely a shepherd's pipe they were used for lamentations and for a certain festivals as in isaiah thirty twenty nine ye shall have a song as in the night when a wholly solemnity is kept and gladness of height as when one goeth with a pipe to come into the mountain of the lord the holy one of israel many of the different names of musical instruments in the common version of the scriptures are merely blunders of the septuagint translators who who rendered the word kin or by about six different terms were no distinction had been originally intended by the sacred riders among the hebrews we find the same progression from men alone as musicians to women almost exclusively and it is likely the that the hebrews gained the idea of from egypt dubow was the discoverer of the harp according to the tradition in genesis and david manifested no loss of manliness while plane before the lord nevertheless when he sang and danced before the argue his wife despised him in her heart miriam the sister her of moses may well have been a professional musician one of the singing and dancing women such as are represented over and over again in the monuments in the time of moses and for some time later women had no status in the public service but in the later days of the second temple the women singers are an important element of the display ezra and nehemiah speak of them and the son of see rack in the apocrypha recommends the reader to beware of female singer is that they entice the not with their charms according to the views of many riders the hebrews had a a larger hype than the small one represented in figure eight it may have been something like the one which was found in egypt but the form is clearly a syrian belonging to the same type as the small harps already given it certainly is not egyptian see figure nine the liturgy of the temple must have been singing utterly noble and imposing never had a church so grand a body of poetry as this of the hebrews which they heard in the very sonorous words of david moses isaiah and ezekiel with all the settled suggestion of a vernacular as employed by minds of the first poet ik order the hebrew parallelism afforded exactly the kind of formula in which one congregation could most effectively respond to another the earth is the lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein for he had founded it upon the seas and as established it upon the floods who shall ascend into the hill of the lord and who shall stand in his holy place when the priests had intoned one line we may suppose that the whole choir of leave it's made answer in the second line completing the parallelism there are others song alms in which the people have a refrain which comes in periodically as for instance in the one oh give thanks unto the lord refrain for his mercy endureth forever psalms one hundred thirty six the voice of these masses stood to the hebrews mind as the feeble type of the great song which should go up from the entire israel of god when the scattered members of the cult were gathered in their time of fullness and glory for as also the same image stands and while the i'd of this venerable and singularly gifted people did not attain a place of commanding influence upon the tunnel side of music it nevertheless has borne no small part in affording advantage ground for later art in the line of noble conceptions inspiring motives and brilliant suggestions it has been and still is one of the most potent influences in the art music of the world nor is it without interest that the scattered representatives of this race have been and continue to be ministers of art in all the lands into which they have come the race of israel has made a proud record in modern music no less than that of the ancient temple part two the assyrians held music and honor and employed it for liturgical purposes as well as those of social and private life among the discoveries at nineveh and babylon are many of a musical character strong bearded men are a plane up on harps which are of a triangular form different structure to annie which we have thus far given see figure ten the one up on the left is a eunuch in the following figure we have the banjo like instrument so constantly seen in the egyptian representations there are several instances of some sort of an instrument apparently consisting of metallic plates or rods played by means of a hammer many have considered these two have been the original type of the modern instruments of percussion were metal plates are vibrated by means of hammers or mallets the following is one of this kind figure twelve of the general appearance of these processions indicates that the assyrians wherein the habit of mass seeing a large number of players upon important occasions we have no idea what the effect of this music can have been but upon the tunnel side it cannot have had any great resonance saw a power power enough if it's satisfied the ears of the dignified players and those who employed there is services as part of the pageant of their great festivals end
