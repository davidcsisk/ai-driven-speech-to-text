chapter three of a popular history of the art of music from the earliest times until the present by wsb matthews this libra vox recording is in the public domain music among the ancient greeks up on several accounts the development of the art of music among the ancient greeks is both important and interesting our word music is there's a carries with its etymology the derivation from the muses the nine agreeable divinities who presided over the more becoming and no buller activities of the greek mind by music the greeks meant much more than merely the tonal art itself under this term they included pretty much all that they had of a liberal education grammar history rhetoric mathematics poetry and song all were included in this one elastic and comprehensive term music itself the art of to tone sequence they called harmony our information concerning the general course of the development of music among this people is pretty accurate through a period of about thirteen hundred years the entire course of the greek history of music may be divided into four great divisions each of which was principal the devoted to a certain part of the art these divisions begin at a date which we might take approximately at about one thousand b c when homeric poems began to be chanted or sung by traveling minstrels called wrap suggests the schools of wrap cities lasted for for about two hundred and fifty years when coral and patriotic song began to be developed in connection with his part of the history there was in the later portion of it a more ornamental and fanciful development of the smaller and social uses of song represented by sappho a knackered jean and others this period endured for about two centuries and a half and by insensible degrees passed into the attic drama which came to its maturity at the hands of escalates sophocles and euripides about four fifty b c here was the culmination of greek music will art upon the purely artistic anaesthetic side then followed a period of philosophizing theory and mathematical deduction which extended to the end of the alexandria in schools about three hundred a d the limits of the present work do not permit tracing this course of progress with the amplitude which it's relation to liberal education would otherwise warrant or even to the extent which it's bearing upon the present ideals of the tonal art would justify were not the range of subjects indispensable to even a summarized treatment of musical history so wide as it has now now become but the general features of the different steps of the greek music or the following as already noticed the earliest traces of music are those in the homeric poems which i thought to have been composed about one thousand b c in these we find the menstrual everywhere as central figure and honored guest ready at call to entertain the company with some ballad of the ancient times or to improvise a new one appropriate to the case in hand the heroes themselves were not loathe to take part in these exercises ulysses the odyssey tells us occasionally took the liar in his own one hand and sang or rhapsody of his own adventures several centuries later as salon one of the famed seven wise men of greece compose the rhapsody of salamis or the last island and sang it in a public assembly of the athenians with so much effect that an expedition one was organized with salon at its head for its recovery which presently followed triumphantly many passages and the odyssey will occur to the classical reader in illustration of the position of the minstrels in argos in the earlier times for example odyssey one one four hundred bryant's translation silent all they sat and listened to the illustrious barred who sang of the calamitous return of the greek coast from troy at the command of palace from her chamber or the hall the daughter of a courteous the sage queen pinel p had heard the heavenly strain and new its theme down by the lofty stairs she came but not alone there followed her to maidens when the glorious lady reached the threshold of the strong built hall where set the suitors holding up a delicate veil before her face and with a gas chef tears the queen bee spake the sacred menstrual thus phineas thou knowest many a pleasing theme the deeds of the gods and heroes such as bards are want to celebrate take then thy place and sing of one of these and let the guests in silence drink the the wine but cease this strain it is too sad it cuts me to the heart and wakes a sorrow without bounds such grief i bear for him my lord of whom i think continually whose glory is abroad through hell us and through our goes everywhere and then tell macos the prudent spake why oh my mother canst thou not endure that thus the well grace poet should delight his hearers with a theme to which is mind is in le moved the bard's deserve no blame jove is the cause for he at will inspires the les that each must sing later than the homeric wraps it is the psionic poems were composed and sung similarly by wondering minstrels who although wondering where not on that account lowly esteemed there were regular schools or more properly guilds of rhapsody lists into which only those were admitted as masters who were able to treat the current topics with the light and inspiring touch of a real poetry and only those taken as apprentices who evinced proper talent and to promise the training of these schools was along party we spent in acquiring technique of treating subjects and the mastery of the liar and partly in memorizing the homeric and has sciatic hymns it is suppose that these poems were transmitted for more than three centuries orally in this way before having been reduced to writing and has the odds poem m of the shield of hercules banks translation three hundred sixty five the general idea of the greek festive processions is illustrated then men and dances and and festive joys held revelry some on the smooth wheeled car a virgin bride conducted then burst forth allowed the marriage song and far and wide long splendors flashed from many a quivering torch born in the hands of slaves gay blooming girls preceded and the dancers followed life these with shrill pipe in dense eating the soft lip grieved melody while broken echoes thrilled around them to the liar with flying touch those led the love in kindle dance a group of youths was elsewhere imaged to the flute disporting some in dances and in song in laughter others as to the minstrels flute so past they on and the whole city seemed as filled with pumps with dances and with feasts so again in the same poem two hundred seventy four there is a scene of a minstrel contest among the immortal gods themselves describe ride by the poet from one of the scenes upon the shield of hercules and the tuneful choir appeared of heavens immortals in the midst the son of jove and of latona sweetly rang up on his golden harp the olympian mount dwelling of god's thrill back the broken sound and there was seen the assembly of the gods listening encircled with be attitude and in sweet contests with apollo their the virgins of peoria raise the strain pre looting and they seemed as though they sang with clear sonorous voices as early as seven fifty b c we find the famous wraps it is to pander summoned to sparta to sing patriotic songs in the hope of preventing a succession of this rather unruly state he accomplished his mission as circumstance creditable alike to the talent of the poet minstrel oh and the high estimation in which the class was held the application of music to patriotic purposes was no novelty plutonic in his life of lycurgus says that fails was famed for his wisdom and his political abilities he was with all a lyric poet who undergo cover of exercising his art performed as great things as the most excellent law givers for his own were so many persuasions to obedience and unanimity as by means of numbers they had great grace and power they softened insensibly the manners of the audience drew them off from the and these which then prevailed and united them in zeal for excellence and virtue again of the subject matter of the spartans songs he says this song's had a spirit which could arouse the soul and impelled to an enthusiastic action the language was plane and manly the subject serious and moral for they consisted chiefly of praises of heroes who had died for sparta or else of expressions of detest station for such a wretches as had declined the glorious privilege about this time the i'd of corals song began to be much cultivated in greece particularly in connection with a cult of certain divinities especially dionysos and apollo by the term corals song we are not to understand anything resembling our singing of a chorus in parts there was no pipe singing in greece but merely a singing or rather chanting of national and patriotic songs in unison accompanied by the sitara the national instrument plato speaks of the imitative and semi dramatic character of the coral dance laws to six hundred fifty five correct movements are imitations of me manners occurring in various actions chances characters each particular is imitated and those to whom the words the songs or a dances i suited either by nature or habit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and calling them beautiful about five hundred b c our room was rented upon the marketplace for the practice of the chorus every town had its body of singers who sang and perform the evolutions of the representative dance appropriate to the service of the particular divinity to whom they were devoted presently competitive singing came in to vogue in connection with the famous games and the art of the poet was taxed as well as the musical and more purely vocal arts of the singers themselves striving an honorable competition for the glory of their native towns in some of the festival occasions the process meetings of the coral songs were varied by the leader who improvised wrap city's up on topics connected with the life of the divinity or upon national stories at proper points the chorus came in with the refrain which remained a fixed quantity being put in apparently at whatever or points the inspiration of breath of the leader needed a point of repose none of these compositions have come down to us but the allusions to them in ancient writings give perhaps a sufficiently accurate idea of their nature the added interest incident to the fresh improvisations of the leader in this form of coral song presently open towards a lyric drama fests buses credited with having been the first to place the leader up on as centrally located stage where he could be plainly seen and heard my all concerned now the recitations became more dramatic the choruses more varied the speaker illustrated by gestures they act switch he described he varied his style of delivery according to the feeling appropriate to the incidents represented the chorus meanwhile was not upon the stage but in a central location below and during their stay groves they circled around the platform of the leader in a sort of mystic dance each man accompanying himself upon his sitara from this to adding a second speaker to the one already upon the stage was but a short step it was taken and the result was a drama with a chorus and connection and in the earlier plays the speakers represented as many characters as necessary for carrying out the action later they changed costume to some extent the chorus meanwhile occupying the time with their own songs which generally had the character of a comment upon the action as does developed at the moment the changes a costume were extremely slight merely a different headdress a mantle or some site modification of appearance more or less symbolical in character all the dialogue was delivered in a musical voice and it is thought all accompanied by the city tara which every player carried in his hand the instrument was sometimes played all the time in the same notes as those of the song or chant at other times the speaker employed it for retour nails for of fourteen breathing time or points of emphasis once in a great while it is thought the instrument had a note different from that of the song in connection with it upon this point great uncertainty prevails at length about four seventy b c aeschylus the great tragedy and made his debut as actor and author and placed three speaker years upon the stage besides the three principles each man had a sweet if his station demanded such an appendage according to the ideas or customs of the times these however had the rank of supernumerary is merely following the speaker around but never taking part in the dialog the principles each represented more than one character effecting some slight change of costume for indicating the transformation the stage was simply an open platform with three doors in the rear the actor entered by one door represented a prince at home from a another a prince abroad by another door he represented a common person the chorus occupied the central place in front of the stage much in the same location as the parquet is now in the center of this space was an altar originally dedicated to dionysos and and offering was probably placed upon it later the korea ghosts or a leader of the chorus set upon it and directed the movements of the singers much as the operatic director does now the theaters were very large being vast amphitheaters open to the sky but with an awning availabe apple over the more expensive seats the seats were of stone arranged exactly like those in a modern circus the theater in athens is said to have held twenty five thousand persons at first admission was free the theater being conducted by the state the plays were mounted very expense civilly of times although with the absence of scenery or properties of an elaborate character it is not easy to imagine what was the use made of the vast sums reported to have been expended in different productions there was a rivalry of leading citizens each taking upon himself the expense of of mounting a new play and striving to outdo the last before him upon the list there were three great dramatic authors whose names have come down to us as the shakespeare's of the athenian drama they were aeschylus sophocles and euripides all were great poets the first perhaps the greatest sophocles was a fine musician and an elegant poet and for many years he remained the popular idol all these men wrote not only the woods of the plays but the music as well every phrase every character having been noted for musical utterance and all the coral effects carefully planned besides this he composed what was then called the orcas stick whence we have our word orchestra by or cast stick they meant an apparatus of mystical dance scene or posturing and marching and certain gestures we do not know precisely what this famous or casting was as for no example of it is come down to us and intelligible form but from the descriptions of it by contemporary writers it seems to have formed the pen to mimic complement of the acting with a certain added grace of art in grouping and posturing suited to attract and satisfy the i of a public accustomed to national games and the beautiful conceptions of phineas upon the parthenon freeze thus as will be readily seen this drama was essentially opera for reasons to be hereafter detailed the music is thought to have been of slight tonal value this she is inferred from the campus of the instruments and the general deficiency of the greeks upon this side although popular report assigns them a place entirely different this mystical drama leaving so much to the imagination and supplementing it's actual representation by the help of chorus and a sort of sanctity derived from music lasted but a few years other causes were at work destined to bring it to a close almost immediately after euripides appeared the great comedy writer or stephanie's about for twenty b c this great artist was not simply a drama this but also a patriot and a philosopher in several of his plays he satirizes the classical dramas effectively parodies their effects and in general pokes fun at them he was however a well accomplished musician who might if he had chosen have gone on in the steps of his predecessors but that we're not favorable to this previous to the time of socrates orators in addressing popular assemblies lawyers including cases and all public speakers appear to have made use of the sitara as a sort of accompaniment if for no other purpose than to assure themselves of securing a proper pitch of the void voice but socrates drew attention to verbal distinctions made words the image of exact concepts and in general set in operation an era of scientific classification and purely intellectual development into which music could not enter especially in a forum so poor up on the tunnel side as greek art than was and always remained then came the great orators of whom dimmest the knees was the greatest who seems to have been the first to speak without musical aids and plato with his philosophy and after him the great aristotle the father as scientific classification an orderly knowledge to a disciple of aristotle our stock sadness we are indebted for the first really musical work which has come down to us it is true that the so called problems of aristotle contain many of a musical character showing that this great master observed tonal effects in a purely musical spirit but he did not make a scientific treatise upon the art in his politics he has much admirable matter relating to music and its influence upon the feelings and it's office in life has hardly been better explain then by him but music upon the practical side remained a sealed at book among the lucid musical questions of aristotle's problems which if not by aristotle himself are at least the product of his time or the succeeding century he refers to the phenomena of sympathetic resonance he asks further why it is that when mesa the keynote of the liar is out of tune everything is out of tune yet when any other string is out of tune it affects only the particular straw ring which is not correctly adjusted one of his most instructive but also as it turned out most misleading questions was why they did not mega dies sing in fourths and fifths as well as in octaves since the consequences of the fourth and the fifth are almost as well sounding as those of the octave this question appears to have led to the practice of what who bowed called diaphanous this question it may be remarked incidentally is conclusive that they did not use the third as a consonance in aristotle's time nor one sing together in fourths fifths or any other intervals than the octave in spite of the talk about music by the greek riders musical theory an exact forum occupies but a small place in the volume of their works the earliest theorist of whom we have any account was pipe daggers who lived about five a d b c he was one of the first of the greek wise men to avail himself of the opening of egypt to foreigners which took place by some medicus first in the year six hundred b c pythagoras live there twenty years in connection with one of the temples where he seems to have gained the confidence of the priesthood and learned much of his philosophy and so called musical science he defined the mathematical relation of the octave as produced by half of a given string the fifth produced by two thirds and the forth by three four earth's he also found the ratio of the major step by subtracting the forth from the fifth this was the ratio nine to eight with this as a major he attempted to place the tones of the tet record or greek scale of four tones which was the unit of their tunnel system this gave him two major steps and a half step somewhat to small being equal to the ratio of two hundred fifty six to two hundred forty three the most important part of pythagoras influence upon the art of music was of a sentimental character from egypt he acquired men the ideas of a musical nature such as that certain tones represented the planets and that time was the essence of all things it was one of the laws of is a religion that before retiring at night his disciples should sing a hymn in order to compose their spirits and prep spare them for rest the versus selected for this use were probably have a devotional character like what are now known as the orphic hymns of which the lines up on the next page may be taken as a specimen ambrose well remarks that such hymns could only have been sung appropriately the to melodies of a coral like character thou ruler of the see the sky the vast abyss thou who shatters the heavens with thy thunder peels thou before whom spirits fall in awe and gods do tremble vowed to whom fates belong so wise so unrelenting vow draw near and shine in us various musicians and theorists later are credited with having made additions to the musical resources of the greeks and it was a proverb said have any smart man that he added a new string to the liar this was set of to pander especially but is pretty certain that the liar had six or seven string some time before to ponder and that the form of expression was purely symbolical as if they had said of him he set the river on fire the first real contributions to musical so science after the problems of aristotle already cited are the to works of his pupil our stocks in his one on harmony the other on rhythm these give a full account of the great musical systems and either source of the greater part of our information upon the subject from them it appears that the basis of their scale was that tet record of four tones placed at an interval of two steps and a half step the outside tones of the tetrick cord remain fixed upon the liar but the to middle ones were varied for the purpose of modulation the dorian tet record corresponded to our succession me face soul law the phrygian re mi fi saw the lydian from do besides these modes the greeks had what they called janeiro of which there were three the diatonic to which the examples already given belong the chromatic in which the the tet record had the form of me far fee law the interval between the two upper tones being equal to a step and a half and the in harmonic in which the first to intervals where one quarter of a step and the upper won a major third we are entirely ignore rent of the practical use made of these different forms of scale whether the quarter and tones were used habitually or were glided like apo tour us or passing tones has been vigorously maintained on both sides by different riders the evidence seems to point to the in harmonic as having been the most ancient and the chromatic and diatonic gradually superseding it in plato aristotle and many of the greek riders especially in athens news much as said about the characteristic expression of the different modes but as they are mutually contradictory one sane of a given mode that it is bold and manly while another calls it feeble and innovating we may leave this for the antiquarians to settle for themselves after aristotle there were several greek theorists who devoted themselves to mathematical computations the f favorite problem seeming to be to find as many ways as possible of dividing the major fourth or the ratio of four to three and to what they called super particular ratios that is to say a series of fractions in which each numerator differed from the denominator by unity they have observe that all the ratios discovered by pythagoras had this character one to two two to three three to four eight to nine and they attributed magical properties to the fact and sought to demonstrate the entire theory of music by the production of sin color combinations the latest rider of the greek school was claudius ptolemy who lived at alexandria about one fifty a d in his work upon harmony he gives a very large number of tables of fractions of this kind his own and those of all previous greek theorists and it is to his book the that we principally oh all the exact knowledge of great musical theory which we possess among other computations ptolemy gives the precise formula of the first four notes of the scale as we now have it but as this occurred only as one among many have a similar character and is in no way distinguished from any of the others by any adjective implying greater confidence in it we can only count it as a lucky accident the eminence that has been awarded to ptolemy as the original discoverer of the correct ratio of the major scale therefore does not pro belong to him this will more clearly appear from the entire table of the various determinations of the diatonic mode made by ptolemy taken from his work edition by john wallace oxford sixteen eighty two pages eighty eight and one hundred seventy two he gives no less than five of his own forms of diatonic generous as follows the fractions give vibration ratios soft diatonic eight to seven by ten to nine by twenty one to twenty equals four two three medium diatonic nine and to eight by eight to seven by twenty eight to twenty seven equals four two three intense diatonic ten to nine by nine to eight by sixteen to fifteen equals four two three equable diatomic ten to nine by a eleven to ten by twelve two eleven equals four two three diatonic diatonic nine to eight by nine to eight by two hundred fifty six to two hundred forty three equals four to three among these there is no one that is correct or rational the proper ratios are given in the diatonic intense but the large and small steps stand in the wrong order it isn't ptolemy's record of the determinations of didymus born at alexandria say sixty three b c that the true tuning of the first four tones of the scale occurs this is it diatonic didymus nine to eight by ten to nine by sixteen to fifteen equals four two three thus it appears that it was didn't us and not ptolemy who propose the tuning of the tet record which is now accepted as correct it is very evident from the entire course of the discussion as conducted by ptolemy that his calculations were purely abstract he is to be reckoned among the pythagoreans who held that in time and number all things consist it was not until some centuries later that the happy thought of didymus came to recognition as the true statement of the mathematical relation of the first four tones of the scale and then only through the ears of a race of musicians following the great theses of a s stocks in us that in music it is always the ear which must be the arbiter and not abstract reasoning or calculation the ratios of the major and minor third also occur among the calculations of didymus but here again they count for nothing in the history of art because these intervals derive their value and expressive quality from their harmonic relation while did him ascend all the greeks employed them as melodic skips only and reckoned them in with a multitude of other skips and progressions without distinguishing them in any way the one characteristic instrument of greek music from the earliest to the latest days was the liar in the oldest times those of homer and has siyad it was called for minx which is believed to have been the form so often represented on greek vases of a turtle shell with side http pieces like horns and instrument having but little effective residence the later forum was the so called sitara the most common shape of which is that made familiar to all by the pedal piece of the square piano forte this instrument rarely had more than six strings and as it had no finger board it could have had no more notes then strings chapel the english historian attempts to demonstrate that certain ones that these instruments had a bridge dividing the strings into two parts thus largely increasing the compass but the evidence supporting this hypothesis is not say satisfactory plato speaks of instruments of many strings imported from asia which seemed to have been the fashion or fad in his day he disapproved of them very heartily but the terms in which he speaks of them show that he cannot have been very familiar with their appearance for it is impossible to make out what he is driving at there is considerable doubt as to the extent to which the larger instruments of asiatic origin penetrated the general musical practice of greece athanasius in his banquets of the learned open parentheses be period roman numeral sixteen teen karma see close parentheses comma quotes and not on as saying i hold my maga this and seeing striking loud the twentieth string loop pap cease at the rapid our leads you to youth and beauties bauer most sir certainly the liar of to ponder had no twenty strings the so called greek flute was a very reedy oboe or clarinet a pie played with a read the pitch determined by whole stopped by the fingers these instruments were so hard to blow that the players wore bands over or their cheeks because there were cases on record where in the contests they broke their cheeks by the wind pressure the flute or allows does not seem to have been used in connection with the satire at all and the greeks had nothing corresponding to what we call an orchestra the as alice was appropriate to certain religious services and to certain festivals and it had a moderate status in the various contests of the national games but the great instrument of great music the universal dependents for all occasions public and private was the liar in spite of the meager resources of greek music upon its tonal side this development of art has had a very important bearing up on the progress of music even down to our own times opera was rediscovered about sixteen hundred and the effort to recreate the greek musical drama and the idea he'll propose to himself by record wagner was nothing else than that of a new music drama in which the severe and lofty conceptions of the old great poets should be embodied in musical forms the most advanced that the modern mind has been able to conceive up upon the aesthetic side musical theory is entirely indebted to the greek nothing more suitable or appropriate can be said concerning musical taste and cultivation than what was said by aristotle three hundred years before christ for example he has the following politics eight see zhao translation page to forty five the customary branches of education are in number for they are one reading and writing to gymnastic exercises three music to which is somewhat added for drawing of these reading writing and drawing are rigged guarded as useful to the purposes of life in a variety of ways he recommends the study of music as part of the preparation of the fit occupation of leisure there remains then the use of music for the intellectual enjoyment of leisure which appears to have been the reason of its introduction this being one of the ways in which it is thought that a free man should pass his leisure as homer says how good it is to invite men to the pleasant feast and afterwards he speaks of others whom he describes as inviting the bard who would delight them all odyssey seventeen three three hundred eighty five and in another place he says that there is no better way of passing life then when men's heights are mary and the banquet years in the hall sitting in order hear the voice of the minstrel plato his particular that only the noble harmonies shall be permitted in his state eight he says of the harmonies i want to have one warlike which will sound the word or note which are brave man others in the our of danger or stern resolve or when his cause is failing nandy is going to wounds or death or is overtaken by some other even youll and in every such crisis meets fortune with calmness and endurance and another which may be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity expressive of in treaty or persuasion or prayer to god or of instruction to man or again willingness to listen to persuasion or entreaty or advice these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and the strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say lie leave these he explains will be only the dorian and the phrygian harmonies in another place plato shows himself a disciple of the egyptian ideas of conservatism already mentioned and therefore when one of these clever and multiforme gentleman who can imitate it comes to our state and proposes to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that there is no place where such as he and our state the law will not allow him and so when we have anointed him with me murder and set a garland of wool up on his head we shall send him away to another city republic jowett three three hundred ninety eight in fact upon the subject of music plato is one of the least satisfactory of riders he as many noble sentiments which might well be printed and letter years of golden hung up on the walls of educational institutions today as laws jowett translation six hundred sixty eight those who seek for the best kind of song and music ought not to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is true in another place however he speak ks of music as a kind of imitation he says that music without words is very difficult to understand laws ebbed six hundred sixty eight all these inconsistencies disappear however as soon as we recognize the limitations of the music which plato new up on its tunnel side all the richness of sense in citation and all the definiteness of expression which come into our modern music through the magic of tones in key were wholly outside the range of plato's knowledge the musical notation of the greeks consisted of letters of the alphabet placed over the syllables to which the tones indicated were to be sung the letters represented absolute pitch and as owing to the variety of genera modes and crow era then total number of tones was very large parts of older forms of the alphabet were also in employed the whole number of characters thus demanded been upwards of seventy there was little or no classification of tones and the entire twenty four letters were applied in regular order to the diatonic series of the dorian mode tones in the chromatic or in harmonic modes were named by other leg authors and the system was extremely complicated the notes of the instrumental accompaniment were still different from those of the vocal part no genuine example of this music has come down to us in reliable form and curiously enough no classical writer gets any idea of the notation of music all that we know of this note station we derived from olympia us who lived about one hundred fifty a d athanasius kircher a jesuit of a
