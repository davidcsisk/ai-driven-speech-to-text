chapter one of our popular history of the art of music from the earliest times until the present by w s p matthews this libor vox recording is in the public domain book first the music of the ancient world primitive types of instruments and an artistic mana d without real tonality chapter one music among the ancient egyptians by a curious fortune we are able to for in approximately accurate idea of the musical instruments in use in egypt as long ago as about four thousand b c the earliest advanced civilization of which any coherent traces have come down to us was developed along the nile where the equable climate and the periodic inundations of the river ver raise the pursuit of the husband men above the uncertainties incident to less favorable climates while at the same time that mild climate reduced to a minimum the demands upon his productive powers for the supply of the necessary is of life this interesting people had a curious custom of depositing the mummies of their dead in twos elaborately hewn out of the rock or excavated in more yielding ground in the hills which border the narrow valley of the nile many of these excavations are a very considerable extent reaching sometimes too the number of twenty rooms and a linear distance of six hundred feet from the entrance the walls of these underground apartments are generally decorated an outline intaglio if the rock be hired or in color if the walls be plaster as is often the case the subjects of the decorations embrace the entire range of the domestic and public life of the people among them been many of a musical character one of the first discoveries of this kind was made toward the close of the preceding century when bruce an english traveler found in a tomb at be been l mu look representations of to magnificently decorated harps played by priests these have since generally been called bruce's harper's the instruments have been represented in many ways by different writers the most curious perversion of the facts been found in bernice history of music where they have the for form of the modern hard figure one harps pipe and flute from an ancient tomb near the pyramids several large works have been devoted to plates of the pictorial discoveries in these ancient tombs but not until the colossal work of lipsius issued under the auspices of the german government were we in possession of data for this study of this civilization from the standpoint of a progressive did valid meant the oldest of the musical representations are found in tombs near thebes and already we find the art in in advance state the preceding cut shows one of these pictures a musical group is represented consisting of eight figures their occupations dead i needed by the hieroglyphics above them the harper is designated as hard scraper it is not possible to make out in the present state of these drawings the exact number of strings up on the hearts but explorers agree that it must have been either five or seven from the length of the straw things and the structure of the instrument without a pillar in front for resisting the of the strings the tones must have been within the register of the male voice the long flute played by the figure burying the number eight must also have produced low tones it is not plane point either these players i supposed to be all plane at the same time or whether they're ministrations may have taken place separately most likely however they all played and saying together figure two bruce's harper's the most advanced types found in egypt where the elegantly colored and ornamented priestly instruments which bruce found in what was after were discovered to be the tomb of ramsey's third at be been alamo luke the black and white cats give but a poor idea of the elaborate structure and rich ornamentation of these fine instruments figure to the instruments are not playing together each harper place before his own particular divinity they occupy opposite sides in the same hall the players by their white robes and positions evidently belonged to the highest order of the priesthood the hype up on the right is represented by some writers is having had twenty one strings whereas the one up on the left has only eleven this would be an interesting fact if it were well founded but unfortunately the truth is that the painting was somewhat defaced after bruce site and it was only with in later years that a clever explore i discovered that by passing a wet sponge over it the original lines could be made out according to let's see as it has thirteen strings in the twentieth dynasty about thirteen hundred b c there were hearts having twenty one strings of which are good examples shown in figure three this instrument also is elaborately colored and ornamented in gold and carving the strings are shorter than those of bruce harper's and the pitch was most likely within the treble register the second figure clapping hands is marking time the one up on the right his plane up on a sort of banjo of which mention will be made presently some time before the period of the higgs says the shepherd kings of the exodus there is a scene of a procession of foreigners presenting tribute to one of the sovereigns of egypt among the figures is one plane up on a sort of liar later this instrument became the established instrument of the high your classes as it was afterward in greece and rome several complete instruments have been found which although dating most likely from a period near the christian era are nevertheless sufficiently like the representations of ten centuries earlier to make them instructive as well as interesting figures for and five are from fat is one of these elias had originally six strings as shown by the notches in the cross peace at the top they were tuned approximately by making the cord tense and then sliding the loop over it's notch from the clever construction of the residents and so cases these instruments should have had a very good quality of tone in some of the later representations there are liars up twenty strings figure six a group of street musicians one woman with tall light heart of fourteen strings to sit tyra three to bunni or banjo for double flute five shoulder heart six singer clapping hands it will be a observe that up to this point all the musicians represented are men in later representations women are more common figure six represents the entire musical culture of the later empire this particular representation belonging apparently to an epic not more than a few centuries before the christian era the hype in this case is have a different construction and lighter than those in the former examples it would seem to have been played while the player walked for we find it in what seems to be moving processions the liar occupies hear the post of honor next the heart the banjo and double flute come next and then a curious instrument of three or four strings played while carried up on the shoulder several of these instruments have been found in a very respectable state of preservation their construction is better shown in the illustrations following the total relation of these instruments to the larger hearts is difficult to conceive wilkinson gives the dimensions of the most perfect one in the british museum as forty one inches long the neck occupying twenty two inches and the body been four inches wide the instrument with a long neck and the short body seen in figures three and six belongs to the banjo family it's residents body consisted of a sort of hoop or a hollowed out piece of sycamore the sounding board been a piece of parchment or rawhide some of these have two strings others one three are occasionally met with if the name of this instrument was to bunni and it was of syrian origin it was afterward known as the mano cord and by it's means all the ancients demonstrated the ratios of the octave fourth and fifth as we will later see we have no knowledge whatever of the tunnel sound of the music which so interested these ancient players and singers there is however an ancient poem called the song of the harper found in a piris dating from about fifteen hundred b c which gives an idea of the sentiments the music was intended to convey it it is from rollins since history of ancient egypt page forty eight the song of the harper from up ah piris of the eighteenth dynasty the great one has gone to his arrest ended his task and his race thus men are i passing away and youths saw i taking their place as raw rises up every morning and tomb every evening death set so women conceive and bring forth and men without ceasing be get each soul in it's turn draws breath each man born of woman sees death takes a pleasure to day father holy one see spices and fragrant oils father we bring to the on thy sisters bosom and i'm and reeves of lotus we place on thy sister due to thy heart i sitting before they face sing the song like music be played and let cares behind the be laid take my pleasure to day in the of joy and delight soon lifespan ogre image ends and we pass to silence and night patriarch perfect and pure neff their hotel blasted one thou didst finish i course up on earth and i are to with a blessing ones now men pass to the silent sure and their place shall know them no more they are as they never had been since the sun went forth upon high they sit on the banks of the stream that flow a thin stillness by thy soul is among them thou dost drink of the sacred tied having the wish of thy heart at peace ever since now has died give bred to the man who is poor and thy name shall be blessed ever more all princely households appear to have had their regular staff of musicians at the head been the over ist of musicians who's tunes still furnish some of the most in struck diva information up on this part of the ancient life people have lower social grade had to be content with a temporary services of the street musicians such as those represented in figure six they played and sang and danced for weddings and festivities and undertook the entire contract of morning for the dead the major been the production of a small vial full of tears under the immediate inspection of the relative of the deceased who's grief might happen to need this official assistance for war like purposes the egyptians had a short trumpet of bronze and a long trumpet not unlike a straight trombone they had drums of many kinds but as none of these instruments have reference to the development of the higher art and music we do not delay to describe them one thing which might surprise us in casting an eye over the foregoing representations as a whole all is the small progress made considering the immensely long period covered by the glimpses we have of the music of this far away race from the days of the harper's in our earliest illustrations to those of the last is more than two thousand years in in fact considerably longer than from the beginning of the christian era until now the explanation is easy to find in the first place the in citations up on the side of sense perception were comparatively meager neither in sonority nor in delicacy of tone no resource where the egyptian instruments a tenth part as stimulating as those of today moreover we have here to deal with child like intelligences slow perceptions and limited opportunities of comparison hence if these were all the discouraging elements is there would be but little cause for wonder at the slow progress but there was another element deeper and more powerful the egyptian mind was conservative to reaction plato in his laws says long ago the egyptians appear to have recognized the very principle of which we are now speaking that they're young citizens must be habituated to the forums and strains of virtue these they have fixed and exhibited the patterns of them in their temples and know painter or artist is allowed to innovate up on them or to leave the traditional forms or invent new ones to this hey no alteration is allowed in these arts nor in music at all and you will find that their works of art are painted or modeled in the same forms that they were ten thousand years ago this is literally true and no exaggeration their ancient paintings and sculptures are not oh quit better or worse than those of today but our with just the same skill this witch doctor draper cause the protective idea was undoubtedly the cause of their little progress in another place plato gives a very interesting glimpse of the egyptian method of education and described something having in it much the spirit of the modern kindergarten he says laws job words translation page eight fifteen in that country systems that calculation have been actually invented for the use of children which they learn as a pleasure and amusement they have to distribute apples and garlands adapting the same number to either a larger or less number of persons and they distribute to pugilists and wrestlers or they follow one another or paired together by lot another motive amusing them is by taking vessels of gold and brass and so silver and the like and mingling them or distributing them without mingling as i was saying they adapt to their amusement the numbers in common use and in this way make more intelligible to their pupils the arrangements and to movements of armies and expeditions and in the manage meant of a household they make people more useful to themselves and wide awake this together with the well known expectation of the egyptians to be judged after death according to the deeds done in the body as our sacred writings have it affords a high idea of their so serious and lofty turn of mind as well as of the great advance they had made toward a true notion of the means of education end of chapter one
