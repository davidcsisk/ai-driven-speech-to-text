chapter three of a popular history of the art of music from the earliest times until the present my s matthews this libra bucks recording is in the public domain music among the ancient greeks up on several accounts the development of the art of music among the ancient greeks is both important and interesting our word music is there's it carries with it's etymology the derivation from the muses the nine agreeable divinities who presided over the more becoming and know bowler activities of the greek mind by music the greeks meant much more than merely that tonal art itself under this term they included pretty much all that they had of a liberal education grammar history rhetoric mathematics poetry and song all were included in this one elastic and comprehensive term music itself the art of to tone sequence they called harmony our information concerning the general course of the development of music among this people is pretty accurate through a period of about thirteen hundred years the entire course of the greek history of music may be divided into four great divisions each of which was principally lee devoted to a certain part of the art these divisions begin at a date which we might take approximately at about one thousand b c when homeric poems began to be chanted or sung by traveling minstrels called rap said ists the schools have wrapped cities lasted for for about two hundred and fifty years when coral and patriotic song began to be developed in connection with this part of the history there was in the later portion of it are more ornamental and fanciful development of the smaller and social uses of song represented by sappho and knackered on and others this period endured for about two centuries and a half and by insensible degrees passed into the attic drama which came to its maturity at the hands of escalators sophocles and your ip it is about four fifty be see here was the culmination of greek music cool art upon the purely artistic anesthetic side then followed a period of philosophizing theory and mathematical deduction which extended to the end of the alexandria in schools about three hundred a d the limits of the present work do not permit tracing this course of progress with the amplitude which it's relation to liberal education would otherwise weren't or even to the extent which it's bearing up on the present ideals of the tonal art would justify were not the range of subjects indispensable to even as summarize treatment of musical history so wide as it has now now become but the general features of the different steps of the greek music or the following as already noticed the earliest traces of music are those in the homeric poems which i thought to have been composed about one thousand b c in these we find the minstrel everywhere a central figure and honored guest ready at call to entertain the company with some ballad of the ancient times or to improvise a new when appropriate to the case in hand the heroes themselves were not loath to take part in these exercises ulysses the odyssey tells us occasionally took the liar in his own hand and sanger rhapsody of his own adventures several centuries later as salon one of the famed seven wiseman of greece composed or rhapsody of salaam as or the last island and saying it in a public assembly of the athenians with so much effect that an expedition he was organized with salon at its head for it's recovery which presently followed triumphantly many passages in the odyssey will occur to the classical reader in illustration of the position of the minstrels and argos in the earlier times for example ah to see one on four hundred bryants translation silent all they sat and listened to the illustrious barred who sang of the calamitous return of the greek coast from troy at the command of palace from her chamber or the hall the daughter of a courteous the sage queen penelope had heard the heavenly strain and knew it it's theme down by the lofty stairs she came but not alone there followed her to maidens when the glorious lady reached the threshold of a strong belt hall were set the suitors holding up a delicate veil before her face and with a guy chef tears the queen bee spate the sacred men strove thus phineas now newest many a pleasing theme the deeds of gods and heroes such as byrds are want to celebrate take then guy place and seen of one of these and let the guests in silence drink the wine but cease this strain it is to say sad it cuts me to the heart and wakes a sorrow without bounds such grief i bear for him my lord of whom i think continually who's glory is a broad through hell us and through our goes everywhere and then tell a mattress the prudent spake why oh my my mother can spell not endure that thus the well grace poet should delight his hearers with a theme to which is mind is in the moved the bard's deserve no blame jove is the cause for he at will inspires the lay that each must seeing later then the homeric wraps it is the has he a palms were composed and son similarly by wondering minstrels who although wondering we're not on that account lonely esteemed there were regular schools or more properly guilds of wraps it is it's into which only those were admitted as masters who were able to treat the current topics with the light and inspiring touch of real poetry and only those taken as apprentices who evinced proper talent and to promise the training of these schools was a long partly spent in acquiring technique of treating subs checks and the mastery of the liar and partly and memorizing the homeric and has see how to him was it is suppose that these poems were transmitted for more than three centuries orally in this way before having been reduced to writing in has see odds poem of the shield of hercules banks translation three hundred sixty five the general idea of the greek festive processions is illustrated than men and dances and and festive joys held revelry some on the smooth wield car a virgin bride conducted then burst forth allowed them marriage song and far and wide long splendors flashed from many a quivering torch born in the hands of slaves gay blooming girls preceded and the dancers followed blithely these with shrill pipe in denting the soft lip grieved melody while broken echoes thrilled around them to the liar with flying touch those led the love in kindle dance a group of youths was elsewhere image to to the flu disporting some and dances and in song in laughter others to the minstrels flute so past they on and the whole city seemed as filled with pumps with dances and with feasts so again in the same poem two hundred seventy four there is a scene of a minstrel contest among the immortal gods themselves described by the point from one of the scenes upon the a shield of hercules and the tuneful choir appeared of heavens immortals in the midst the son of job and of latona sweetly rang up on his golden heart the olympian mount dwelling of god's thrill back the broken sound and there were seen this simply of the guy odds listening encircled with be attitude and in sweet contests with apollo their the virgins of p area raise the strain looting and they seemed as though they sang with clears sonorous voices as early as seven fifty b c wi fi and the famous wraps it is to pander summoned to sparta to sing patriotic songs in the hope of preventing a secession of this rather unruly state he accomplished his mission as circumstance creditable i like to the talent of the poet minstrel and the high estimation in which the class as was held the application of music to patriotic purposes was no novelty plutarch and his life of lycurgus said is that fails was famed for his wisdom and his political abilities he was with all a lyric poet who under cover of exercising his art performed as great things as the most excellent law givers for his odds were so many persuasions to obedience and unanimity as by means of numbers they had great race and power they softened insensibly the manners of the audience drew them off from the animosities which then prevailed and you know the mean zeal for excellence and virtue again of the subject matter of the spartan songs he says this song's had a spirit which could arouse the soul and impelled to an enthusiastic action the language was plane and manly the subject serious and moral for they consisted chiefly of praise his of heroes who had died for sparta or else of expressions of detest station for such wretches as had declined the glorious privilege about this time the idea of corals song began to be much cultivated in greece particularly in connection with the cult of certain divinities especially lead die on this sauce and apollo by the time corals song we are not to understand anything resembling our singing of a chorus in parts there was no part singing in greece but merely as singing or rather chanting of national and patriotic songs in unison when accompanied by the setara the national instrument plato speaks of the imitative and semi dramatic character of the coral dance laws to six hundred fifty five correct movements are imitations of manners occurring in various actions his chances characters each particular is imitated and those to whom the words the songs or advances are suited either by nature are habit or both cannot help feeling pleasure in them and calling them beautiful about five hundred b c or room was rented upon the marketplace for the practice of the chorus every town had it's body of singer is who's saying and perform the evolutions of the representative dance appropriate to the service of the particular divinity to whom they were devoted presently competitive singing came into vogue in connection with the famous game games and the art of the poet was taxed as well as the musical and more purely vocal i'd said the singers themselves striving an honorable competition for the glory of their native towns in some of the festival occasions the proceedings of the corals songs were varied by the law leader who improvised rhapsody ease up on topics connected with the life of the divinity or upon national stories at proper points the chorus came in with the refrain which remained a fixed quantity been put in apparently at whatever points the inspiration of breath of the leader needed a point of repos none of these compositions have come down to us but the allusions to them and ancient writings give perhaps a sufficiently accurate idea of their nature the added interest incident to the fresh improvisations of the leader in this form of coral song presently open toward a lyric drama fests buses credited with having been the first replace the leader up on as centrally located stage where he could be plainly seen and heard my all concerned now the recitations became more dramatic the choruses more varied the speaker illustrated by gestures the acts which he described he varied his style of delivery according to the feeling appropriate to the incidents represented the chorus meanwhile was not up on the stage but in a central location below and during their strobes they circled around the platform of the leader and a sort of mystic dance each man accompanying himself up on his setara from this to adding a second speaker to the one already up on the stage was better short step it was taken and the result was a drama with a chorus and connection in the earlier plays the speakers were i presented as many characters as necessary for carrying out the action later they changed costume to some extent the chorus meanwhile occupying the time with their own songs which generally had the character of a comment upon the action as developed at the moment the changes a cost to boom were extremely slight merely a different headdress a mantle or some sites modification of appearance more or less symbolically character all the dialogue was delivered in a musical voice and it is thought all accompanied by the cetera which every player carried in his head and the instrument was sometimes played all the time in the same notes as those of the song or chant at other times the speaker employed it for retour nails for a fourteen breathing time or points of emphasis once in a great while it is thought the instrument had a note diff for from that of the song in connection with it upon this point great uncertainty prevails at length about four seventy b c as colors the great tragedy and made his debut as actor and offer and placed three speakers up on the stage besides the three pray suppose each man had a sweet if his station demanded such an appendage according to the ideas or customs of the times these however had the rank of supernumerary is merely following the speaker around but never taking part in the dialogue the principles each represented more than one character effecting some slight change or costume for indicating the transformation the stage was simply an open platform with three doors in the rear the actor entered by one door represented a prince at home from another a prince abroad by another day or he represented a common person the chorus occupied the central place in front of the stage much in the same location as the parquet is now in the center of this space was an altar originally dedicated to die on this sauce and an offering was probably placed upon it later the korea ghosts or leader of the chorus set upon it and directed the movements of the singers much as the operatic director does now the theaters were very large being vast amphitheaters open to the sky but with an awning available over the more expensive seats the seats were of stone arranged exactly like those in a modern circus the theater in athens is said to have held twenty five thousand persons at first admission was free the theater being conducted by the state the plays were mounted very expensive of times although with the absence of scenery or properties of an elaborate character it is not easy to imagine what was the use made of the vast sums reported to have been expended indifferent different productions there was a rivalry of leading citizens each taking upon himself the expense of mounting a new play and striving to outdo the last before him up on the list there were three great dramatic authors whose names have come down to us as the shakespeare's of the athenian drama they were as scullers sophocles and everybody's all were great poets the first perhaps the greatest sophocles was a fine musician and and al megan poet and for many years he remains popular idol all these men wrote not only the words of the plays but the music as well as rephrase every character having been noted for musical utterance and all the coral effects carefully planned besides this he composed what was then call all of the or cast stick quince we have our word orchestra by or cast stick they meant an apparatus of mystical dancing or posturing and marching and certain gestures we do not know precisely what this famous or cast stick was for know example of it is come down to us in intelligible form but from the descriptions of it by contemporary writers it seems to have formed the pen to mimic compliment of the acting with a certain added grace of art and grouping and posturing suited to attract and satisfy the i have a public accustomed to national game it's and the beautiful conceptions of videos upon the parthenon freeze thus as will be readily seen this drama was essentially opera for reasons to be here after detailed the music is thought to have been of slight or value this is inferred from the compass of the instruments and the general deficiency of the greeks up on this side although popular report assigns them are place entirely different this mystical drama leaving so much to the imagination and supplementing it's actual representation by the help of chorus and assertive sanctity derived from music lasted but a few years other causes were at work destined to bring it to a close almost immediately after your rip it is appeared the great comedy writer aristophanes about for twenty be see this great artist was not simply a dramatist but also a patriots and of hello i suffer in several of his plays he satirizes the classical dramas effectively parodies their effects and in general pokes fun at them he was however a well accomplished musician who might if he had chosen have gone on in the steps of his predecessors but the times are not favorable to this previous two socrates orators in addressing popular assemblies lawyers and pleading cases and all public speakers appear to have made use of the setara as a sort of accompaniment if for no other purpose than to assure themselves of securing a proper pitch of the voice but socrates drew attention to verbal distinctions made words the image of exact concepts and in general said in operation an era of scientific classification and purely intellectual development into which music could not enter especially in a form so poor up on the tunnels side as greek art then was and always remained then came the great orators of whom dumbest the knees was the greatest who seems to have been the first to speak without musical aids and plato with his philosophy and after him the great aristotle the father of scientific classification an orderly knowledge to a disciple of aristotle our stocks and knows we are indebted for the first really musical work which has come down to us it is true that the so called problems of aristotle contain many of our musical character showing that this great master observed tonal effects in a purely musical spirit but he did not make a scientific treatise upon the arts in his politics he has much admirable matter relating to me isaac and it's influence upon the feelings and it's office in life has hardly been better explain then by him but music upon the practical side remained a sealed the book among the lucid musical questions of aristotle's problems which if not by aristotle himself are at least the product of his to time for the succeeding century he refers to the phenomena of sympathetic resonance he asks further why it is that when mesa the keynote of the liar is out of tune everything is out of tune yet when any other string is out of tune it affects only the particular stream in which is not correctly adjusted one of his most instructive but also as it turned out most misleading questions was why they did not mega dies sing in forests and fifths as well as in octaves since the and says of the fourth and the fifth are almost as well sounding as those of the octave this question appears to have led to the practice of what hook bows called die off any this question it may be remarked incidentally is conclusive that they did not use the third as a consonants in aristotle's time noticing sing together in fourths fifths or any other intervals then the octave in spite of the talk about music by the greek riders musical theory and an exact form occupies but a small place in the volume of their works the earliest theorist of whom we have any account was python eggers who lived about five eighty b c he was one of the first of the greek wise men to avail himself of the opening of egypt to foreigners which took place by semitic us first in the year six hundred b c pythagoras live there twenty years in connection with one of the temples where he seems to have gain the confidence of the priesthood and learned much of his philosophy and so called musical science he defined the mathematical relation of the active as produced by half of a given stream the fifth produced by two thirds and the forth by three forth it's he also found the ratio of the major step by subtracting a forth from the fifth this was the race show nine to eight with this as a major he attempted to place the tones of the tech record or greek scale of four tones which was the unit up their tunnel system this gave him two major steps and a half step some somewhat to small being equal to the ratio of two hundred fifty six to two hundred forty three the most important part of pythagoras influence upon the art of music was of a sentimental character from egypt he acquired many ideas of a musical nature such as that certain tones represented the planets and that time was the essence of all things it was one of the laws of his religion that before retiring at night his disciples should sing a him in order to compose their spirits and prepare where them for rest the vs selected for this use were probably have a devotional character like what are now known as the orphic hands of which the lines up on the next page may be taken as a specimen ambrose well remarks that such hymns could only have been sung appropriately the to melodies of a coral like character thou ruler of the see the sky the vast abyss vow who shatters the heavens with a thunder appeals vow before whom spirits fall in ah and gods do trimble vow to whom fates be long so wise so so unrelenting vow draw near and shine in us various musicians and theorists later are credited with having made additions to the musical resources of the greeks and it was a proverb said of any smart man that he added a new string to the liar the this was set of to pander especially but is pretty certain that the liar had six or seven string some time before to ponder and that the form of expression was purely symbolical as if they had set of him he set the river on fire the first real contributions to musical science it's after the problems of aristotle already cited are the to works of his pupil are his stocks in his one on harmony the other on rhythm these give a full account of the great musical systems and i the source of the greater part of our information up on the subject from them it appears that the base this of their scale was that ted record of four tones placed at an interval of two steps and a half step the outside tones of attach record remain fixed up on the liar but the to middle ones were varied for the purpose of modulation the dorian tetra record corresponded to hours succession me far soul law the phrygian re mi fire so the lady in from dough besides these modes the greeks had what they call janeiro of which there were three the diatonic to which the examples already given belong the chromatic in which that that record had the form of me far he law the interval between the two upper tones being equal to a step and a half and the and harmonic in which the first two intervals where one quarter of a step and the upper won a major third we are entirely ignorant of the practical use made of these different forms of scale whether the quarter and tones were used habitually or were glided like apogee arcturus or passing tomes has been vigorously maintained on both sides by different writers the evidence seems to point to the and huh harmonic as having been the most ancient and a chromatic and diatonic gradually superseding it and plato aristotle and many of the greek riders especially in athens and nice much is said about the characteristic expression of the different modes but as they are mutua really contradictory one scene of a given mode that it is bold and manly while another calls it feeble and innovating we may leave this for the and aquariums to settle for themselves after aristotle there were several greek theorists who devoted themselves to mathematical computations the favorite problem seeming to be to find as many ways as possible of dividing the major fourth or the ratio for to three and to what they called super particular race shows that is to say a series of fractions in which each numerator differed from the denominator by unity they had a sir that all the ratios discovered by pythagoras had this character one to two two to three three to four eight to nine and they attributed magical properties to the fact and sought to demonstrate the entire theory of music by the production of similar combinations the latest writer of the greek school was claudius ptolemy who lived at alexandria about one fifty a d in his work up on harmony he gives a very large the number of tables or fractions of this kind his own and those of our previous greek theorists and it is to his book that we principally oh all the exact knowledge of greed musical theory which we possess among other computations ptolemy gives the precise formula of the first four or notes of the scale as we now have it but as this occurred only as one among many have a similar character and is in no way distinguished from any of the others by any adjective implying greater confidence in it we can only count it as a lucky accident the eminence that been awarded to ptolemy as the original discoverer of the correct ratio of the major scale therefore does not properly belong to him this will more clearly appear from the entire table of the various determinations of the diatonic mode made by ptolemy taken from his work edition by john wallace oxford sixteen eighty two pages eighty eight and one hundred seventy two he gives no less than five of his own forms of diatonic janice as follows the fractions give vibration ratios soft diatonic eight to seven by ten to nine by twenty one to twenty equals four two three medium diatomic nine to eight by eight to seven by twenty eight to twenty seven equals four two three intense diatomic ten to nine by ninety eight by sixteen to fifteen equals four two three equable diatomic ten to nine by eleven to ten by twelve two eleven equals four two three diet time make diatomic nine to eight by nine two eight by two hundred fifty six to two hundred forty three he goes for two three among these there is no one that is correct or rational the proper ratios are given in the diatonic intense but the large and small steps stay and in the wrong order it isn't ptolemy his record of the determinations of didymus blind at alexandria sixty three be see that that true tuning of the first four tones of the scale occurs this is it diatomic didymus nine to eight by ten to nine by sixteen to fifteen equals four two three thus it appears that it was didymus and not ptolemy who proposed the tuning of the ted record which is now accepted as correct it is very evident from the entire course of the discussion as conduct did by ptolemy that his calculations were purely abstract he has to be reckoned among the pythagoras eons who held that in time and number all things consist it was not until some centuries later that they're happy thought of didymus came to recognition as the true statement of the mathematical really asian of the first four tones of the scale and then only through the ears of a race of musicians following the great feces of eris stocks and us that in music it is always the ear which must be the arbitrary and not abstract reasoning or calculation the ratios of the major and minor third also occur among the calculations of did he miss but here again they count for nothing in the history of art because these intervals derive their value and expressive quality from their harmonic relation while didymus and all the greeks employed them as melodic skips only the and reckon them in with a multitude of other skips and progressions without distinguishing them in any way the one characteristic instrument of greek music from the earliest to the latest stays was the liar and the oldest times those of homer and has odd it was called for for minx which is believed to have been the form so often represented on greek vases of a turtle shell with side pieces like horns an instrument having but little affected residents the later form was the so called setara the most common shape of which is that made familiar to ah all by the pedal piece of the square piano forte this instrument rarely had more than six strings and as it had no fingerboard it could have had no more notes then strings chapel the english historian attempts to demonstrate that certain ones of these instruments had a brew ridge dividing the strings into two parts thus largely increasing the campus but the evidence supporting this hypothesis is not satisfactory plato's speaks of instruments of many strings imported from asia which seem to have been the fashion or fad in his day he disapproved of them very heartily but the terms in which he speaks of them show that he cannot have been very familiar with their appearance for it is impossible to make out what he is driving at various considerable doubt as to the extent to which the larger instruments of asiatic origin penetrated the general musical practice of greece anthony us in his banquets of the learned open parentheses be period roman numeral sixteen karma see close parentheses karma quotes and macri on as saying i hold my at this and seeing striking loud the twentieth string loop have cease at a rapid our leads you to youth and beauty is bauer most certainly the liar of to pander had no twenty strings the so called greek flute was a very reedy oboe or clarinet a pie played with a read the pitch determined by holes stopped by the fingers these instruments were so hard to blow that the players wore bands over their cheeks because there were cases on record were in the contests they broke their cheeks by the wind pressure the flute or owl los does not see seem to have been used in connection with the sit tyra at all and the greeks had nothing corresponding to what we call an orchestra the alice was appropriate to certain religious services and to certain festivals and it had a moderate status in the various contests of the national games but the great instrument of great music the universal dependence for all occasions public and private was the liar in spite of the meager resources of great music upon its tunnel side this development of it has had a very important burying up on the progress of music even down to our own times opera was rediscovered about sixteen hundred and the effort to recreate the greek musical drama and the ideal proposed to himself by ricard wagner was nothing else than that of a new music drama in which the severe and lofty conceptions of the old greek poets should be embodied and musical forms the most advanced that the modern mind has been able to conceive up on the aesthetics side music oh theory is entirely indebted to the greek nothing more suitable are appropriate can be said concerning musical taste and cultivation then what was said by aristotle three hundred years before christ for example he has the following politics eight siege our it's translation page to forty five the customary branches of education are in number for they are one reading and writing to gymnastic x or sizes three music to which is somewhat added for drawing of these reading writing and drawing are regarded as useful to the purposes of life in a variety of ways he recommends the study of music as part of the preparation of the fit occupation of leisure very maine's then the use of music for the intellectual enjoyment of leisure which appears to have been the reason of it's introduction this being one of the ways in which it is thought that a free man should pass his leisure as homer says how good it is to invite men to the pleasant feast and afterwards he speaks of others his whom he describes as inviting the barge who would delight them all odyssey seventeen three hundred eighty five and in another place he says that there is no better way of passing life then when men's hearts are mary and the banquet years in the house sitting in order hear the voice of the minstrel plato is particular that only lee the noble harmonies shall be permitted in his state he says of the harmonies i want to have one war like which will sound the word or note which a brave man otters in the our of danger or stern resolve or when is cause is failing nandy is going to woo runes are death or is overtaken by some other evil and in every such crisis meets fortune with calmness and endurance and another which may be used by him in times of peace and freedom of action when there is no pressure of necessity expressive of in treaty or persuasion or prayer to god or of instruction to man or again willingness to listen to persuasion are in treaty or advice these two harmonies i ask you to leave the strain of necessity and a strain of freedom the strain of the unfortunate and the strain of the fortunate the strain of courage and the strain of temperance these i say leave these he explains will be only that dorian and the phrygian harmonies and another place plato shows himself a disciple of the egyptian ideas of conservatism already mentioned therefore when one of these clever and multiforme gentleman who can imitate anything comes to our state and proposes to exhibit himself and his poetry we will fall down and worship him as a sweet and holy and wonderful being but we must also inform him that there is no place where such as he and our state the law will not allow him and so when we have anointed him with murder and set a garland of will up on his head we shall send him away to another city republic jowett three three hundred ninety eight in fact up on the subject of music plato is one of the least satisfactory of writers he as many noble sentiment switch might well be printed in letters of gold and hung up on the walls of educational institutions today as laws javits translation six hundred sixty eight those who seek for the best kind of song and music art not to seek for that which is pleasant but for that which is true in another place however he speaks of music as a kind of imitation he says that music without words is very difficult to understand laws a bid six hundred sixty eight all these inconsistency disappear however as soon as we recognize the limitations of the music which plato new up on its tunnel side all the richness of sense in citation and all that definite nis of expression which come into our modern music through the magic of tones in key were wholly outside the range of plato's knowledge the musical notation of the greeks consisted of letters of the alphabet placed over the syllables to which the tones indicated were to be some the letters represented absolute pitch and as oh when to the variety of genera modes and crow a than total number of tones was very large parts of older forms of the alphabet were also employed the whole number of characters thus demanded being upwards of seventy there was little or no classification of tones and the entire twenty four letters were applied in regular order to the diatonic see series of the dorian mode tones in the chromatic or in harmonic modes were named by other letters and the system was extremely complicated the notes of the instrumental accompaniment were still different from those of the vocal part no genuine example of this music has come down to us in reliable form and curiouser the enough know classical writer gives any idea of the notation of music all that we know of this
